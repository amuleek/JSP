The following are the paths followed by a JSP −
>Compilation:
When a browser asks for a JSP, the JSP engine first checks to see whether it needs to compile the page. 
If the page has never been compiled, or if the JSP has been modified since it was last compiled, the JSP engine compiles the page.
The compilation process involves three steps −
-Parsing the JSP.
-Turning the JSP into a servlet.
-Compiling the servlet.
>Initialization:
When a container loads a JSP it invokes the jspInit() method before servicing any requests. 
If you need to perform JSP-specific initialization, override the jspInit() method −

public void jspInit()
{
   // Initialization code...
}
Typically, initialization is performed only once and as with the servlet init method, you generally initialize database connections, open files, and create lookup tables in the jspInit method.
>Execution:
This phase of the JSP life cycle represents all interactions with requests until the JSP is destroyed.
Whenever a browser requests a JSP and the page has been loaded and initialized, the JSP engine invokes the _jspService() method in the JSP.
The _jspService() method takes an HttpServletRequest and an HttpServletResponse as its parameters as follows −

void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
{
   // Service handling code...
}
>Cleanup:
