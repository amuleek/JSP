The following are the paths followed by a JSP −
>Compilation:
When a browser asks for a JSP, the JSP engine first checks to see whether it needs to compile the page. 
If the page has never been compiled, or if the JSP has been modified since it was last compiled, the JSP engine compiles the page.
The compilation process involves three steps −
-Parsing the JSP.
-Turning the JSP into a servlet.
-Compiling the servlet.
>Initialization:
When a container loads a JSP it invokes the jspInit() method before servicing any requests. 
If you need to perform JSP-specific initialization, override the jspInit() method −
for example :
public void jspInit()
{
   // Initialization code...
}
>Execution:
>Cleanup:
