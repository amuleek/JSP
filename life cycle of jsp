A Java Server Page life cycle is defined as the process started with its creation which later translated to a servlet and afterward servlet lifecycle comes into play. 
Steps involved for Jsp life cycle:
>Translation of JSP page to Servlet
>Compilation of JSP page(Compilation of JSP into test.java)
>Classloading (test.java to test.class)
>Instantiation(Object of the generated Servlet is created)
>Initialization(jspInit() method is invoked by the container)
>Request processing(_jspService()is invoked by the container)
>JSP Cleanup (jspDestroy() method is invoked by the container)

JSP Cleanup :
In order to remove the JSP from use by the container or to destroy method for servlets jspDestroy()method is used.
This method is called once, if you need to perform any cleanup task like closing open files, releasing database connections jspDestroy() can be overridden.
